# 鴨ゲームかも
これが鴨音ゲーかも。(This is probably a duck rhythm game.)

## Description
We created this game for the Chonk Duck Jam at itch.io: [Chonk Duck Jam](https://itch.io/jam/chonk-duck-jam)

This game is a rhythm game featuring an anime girl riding a chonky duck! All the art and assets are original creations of developer, artist, and music producer: DIceEvYo. NefariousNeo contributed to the design and also developed the game, writing most of the game logic and code.

The controls are simple: WASD keys, arrow keys, or controller joystick or D-Pad. You can hit the ESC key to open the pause menu but use the buttons to resume, go to the options menu, or exit because hitting the ESC key again will not bring you back to the game.

## Game Engine and Programming Language Used
100% Godot and GDScript
